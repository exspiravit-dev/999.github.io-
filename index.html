<title>Sorry Everyone</title>
<center>
I've messed up a lot in my life, this is one of those breaking points for me... Sad as it is to say, it just isn't worth it for me anymore to be around, if anyone cares: Just wanted to say to all the people I've ever fucked over, I'm sorry. I was never a selfish person, some things in my life just lead me down a path of being that way and I apologize and I hope you can forgive. To everyone, I'll miss you, to lena, I'm sorry for doing what I did, but there was no love in what I ever did with that girl, she didn't mean anything to me, I've always had bad outlets of making myself feel better, I never did it to anyone before, but I did it to you, I'm not a liar, and I've never liked it. This whole situation with the authorities forced me to hide my identity and be a liar and steal money to fix my issues that no one else wanted to help fix. It was a lot of money to say the least... The funny thing that it wasn't worth a single dime. It made me lose a lot of people, and it made me lose you, you meant a lot more to me than anyone. It's hard to tell behind a screen but that's the truth, and it's saddening to me that you don't care anymore, I thought there was hope at the end of it, that we could just go back and it didn't feel weird and we could just be honest towards each other and there wasn't such a depressing mood all the time (coming from me) but I didn't know how to ultimately handle it. I hope your issues get figured out, I'll have someone contact you in 48 hours, all of my accounts have been sold off. I'll miss you, and I'll miss everyone that cared, and I'm sorry to the people I've hurt. :(

My real name will reappear here in a few days through something I've automated. Hope everyone has a great life. I'll miss you many, I'll miss you rb0s, I'll miss you sare, I'll miss you stella, I'll miss you kaydexx, and everyone else I've ever interacted with, to my family I'm sorry. :( <3

I just wanted to reiterate that this has nothing to do with me or lena, but everything that's came upon this point. This isn't a cry for attention, this isn't a joke, this isn't anything but pure whole heartedness.

I'll be giving away every cent of my stolen money to a charity.
